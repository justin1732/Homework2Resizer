This was the second graded assignment for the University of Denver coding bootcamp. This took the basic HTML/CSS properties of previous activities and worked to apply Bootstrap CSS to them to make them work and function better. This file can be seen by cloning the repo and running it on your local machine. This uses only HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap CSS.
