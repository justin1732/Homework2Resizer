# Homework2Resizer
This was the second graded assignment for the University of Denver coding bootcamp. This took the basic HTML/CSS properties of previous activities and worked to apply mobile-resizing to the HTML components to see the difference.  This file can be seen by cloning the repo and running it on your local machine. This uses only HTML and CSS.
